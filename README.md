# MalduinoLite_Windows_Drive_Formater
This is a script for the Arduino IDE for the Malduino_Lite that makes the Malduino format any drive on the host computer it is used on. NOTE: The computer has to be logged in with admin. 

There are two versions packaged: "Malduino_DRIVE_FORMATER" & "Malduino_DRIVE_FORMATER_RickRoll"

The Only diffrence is the "Malduino_DRIVE_FORMATER_RickRoll" file plays Rick Astley's never gonna give you up this adress "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" before running the main drive format program.

Note: You must select the correct bord type in the Arduino IDE to upload this code. (There are many good tutorials on youtube).

How it works:
  The program (when run on a computer logged in as administrator) will format all the drives connected to your computer (this includes usb drives as well) when executed. It does this by running a command prompt and individually formating each drive.
  
  Disclamer: I am not to be held responseable for any use of this code and it is to be used at your own risk.
  
  Thank you and enjoy.
